# Reading this book
This book is by no means the complete guide into everything JS, it's merely the tip of the iceberg, but it's a decent introduction to the language, in a practical and doable manner.

To get up and running we need a little theory, if you hang on we'll get to the fun parts soon enough.
 
The first TODO chapters are mainly theory, and then in chapter X we build our first project.

On some of the pages you'll be asked to test your knowledge by writing some JS code in a comment box like the one below, go ahead and try it now

{% exercise %}
Say hello to JS by typing in the following in, between the quotes, the "console" below:

"Hello JS"

{% initial %}
let greeting = "";

{% solution %}
let greeting = "Hello JS";

{% validation %}
assert(greeting == "Hello JS");

{% endexercise %}

Doing these exercises are crucial to your understanding, they might seem simple but **NO ONE HAS EVER LEARNED A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE WITHOUT PROGRAMMING!!!**

So during your reading, start giving yourself small exercises as well, do the same things we do in this book, but on your own HTML & CSS (which you'll learn to do in the next chapter)
