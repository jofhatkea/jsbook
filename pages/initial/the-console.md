# The `console`
So, once again, we'll dive deeper into this at a later point, for now, I just wanna introduce the `console`. 

The `console` is our primary debugging tool, it's the best way to inspect our code and find errors, actually, it's the only place you'll see errors, so, when you're missing a single . in your code, and nothing works, the console can help you.

It's a bit frightning at first, but **read through the error messages** and you'll get the hag of it

In chrome you open the console by right-clicking and choosing "Inspect" and the clicking the "Console" tab

## Have it open at all times
